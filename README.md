config files on tharpe host

Lenovo ideapad 110.

I customize this simple and usable installation to my mother laptop. Is a minimal Debian GNU/Linux stretch + openbox desktop over a crypt LVM volume.

To gain usability added an auto_login option with her username and password to the slim display manager. I consider users password its not neccesary since its a single user host and at boot sequence decrypt fs password its required.

Linux version 4.9.0-3-amd64 (debian-kernel@lists.debian.org) (gcc version 6.3.0 20170425 (Debian 6.3.0-16) ) #1 SMP Debian 4.9.25-1 (2017-05-02)
